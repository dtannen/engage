Build a server to capture scroll depth, scroll velocity (pixels/s) and time on page.

Object per impression should be:

{
	“account_id”: “xyz”,
	“campaign_id”: “xyz”,
	“creative_id”: “abc”,
	“impression_id”: “123abc”,
	“data”: {
		“scroll_depth”: %
		“scroll_velocity”: px/s
		“time_on_page”: seconds
	}
}

Object for account:

{
	“id”:”xyz”,
	“username”:”xxx”,
	“password”:”hashed_password”,
	“endpoint”:”anotherserver.com/endpoint”,
	“daily_limit”:”1000”,	
}

Javascript to capture scroll depth:

http://scrolldepth.parsnip.io/

Strategy for server-side capture:

a) Open web socket and pass updated stats every 5 second and update server-side object.  Once socket is broken store to DB.  
   If impression_id was already passed then ignore.  Pass to endpoint for account if exists.
b) Capture and store stats on client-side until user leaves the page and pass stats to the server.

Server must have quotas & rate limiting per account

API must be available to pull data for each impression or aggregate by creative, campaign or account.

Consider using tyk as a gateway to service: 
https://tyk.io/ to get all the authentication, rate limiting, admin interface, etc. out of the box.

API must have the ability to specify an endpoint for an account to send completed JSON.  
i.e. A person visits a page with the javascript for tracking and after they leave a page a server-side call is made to anotherserver.com/endpoint with the JSON containing the stats

Also, the account_id, campaign_id, creative_id and impression_id should be captured from url:  taid=XX&tcid=XX&tcrid=XX&tid=XX 
or account_id can be hardcoded in the page javascript and the rest passed through the URL.

[consider also using utm parameters used in google analytics]
If impression id is null then we aggregate hourly stats by account/campaign/creative and delete all the individual data.
